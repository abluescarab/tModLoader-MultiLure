MultiLure is a mod that adds a configurable number of lures while fishing and allows you to carry multiple quest fish in your inventory. MultiLure now also allows you carry around up to 99 quest fish in a stack. 

**Note:** if a quest fish is in your inventory when you cast, you still can't catch any more than what you're already carrying. Drop the existing fish or put them in a chest and try again.

* Includes Cheat Sheet and HERO's Mod integration (hotkeys work with or without integration)
* Press [ to remove a lure
* Press ] to add a lure
* Hold shift to add/remove 10 lures (works with both hotkeys and Cheat Sheet/HERO's Mod)
